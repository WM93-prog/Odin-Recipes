    <h1>Gambas al ajillo</h1>
<img src="../Images/Gambas.jpg" alt="Prawns in a garlic and olive oil sauce">

<p>My simple and authentic gambas al ajillo 
   recipe makes the most delicious Spanish garlic shrimp you can imagine! 
   This <em>popular</em> Spanish tapas dish is one of my favorites (and it's ready in only 10 minutes!).</p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   
   <ul>
    <li>500g of Prawns</li> 
    <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Minced garlic about 1 tablespoon per person, 
    you can put less or more</li>
    <li>A splash of dry sherry</li>
    <li>Butter to finish</li>
   </ul> 
   
   
   <h3>Instructions</h3>

   <ol>
    <li><p>My mother-in-law makes these in individual sized clay dishes (cazuelitas) that you can put directly on the stove to cook in. Here I'll assume most will make the dish in one large pan and then plate separately.
        If the shrimp haven't been shelled, remove the shells</p></li>
    <li><p>Completely cover the bottom of a large frying pan with olive oil and slowly heat along with the garlic and cayenne pepper pods.</p></li>

     

   
    
    3.When the garlic begins to sizzle add the shrimp and saut√© a moment.
    
    4.Once everything starts to sizzle again, add a splash of sherry and a sprinkle of salt.
    
    5.Simmer for about a minute until the shrimp are cooked through (don't overcook!)
    
    6.Remove from the heat and divide into four servings.
    
    7.Top each serving with a touch of butter, and give it a quick stir before serving.</p>
