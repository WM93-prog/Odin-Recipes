    <p>Looking for an authentic Spanish tortilla recipe? You've come to the right place</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2lbs of Potatos</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>8 Large eggs</li>
        <li>1 white onion</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    
    <br>

    <p><strong>A little trick i use is to microwave the cut potatos and onions first before adding them to the pan.(This avoids any potential burning)</strong></p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p><em>You can buy dedicated tortilla pans but a heavy bottom thick walled non stick small frying pan will be just as good</em></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Chip the potatos and onions relatively finely into a bowl and place into the microwave for 5 mins checking regularly until cooked through(Adjut time as needed). If you aren't using a microwave then place the potatos and onions
            and potatos into a pan and fry gentle on a medium to low heat until cooked through. (If using the microwave method just add straight to a frying pan and brown for a few minutes)  </li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are cooked an browned,regardless of method used, spread them flat acorss the bottom of the pan and pour over the eggs</li>
        <li>Cook on a low heat until it is firm when you put a knife into the tortilla.</li>
        <li>Now for the tricky bit! Place a large plate over the pan and quickly flip the tortilla over. Slide it back into the pan and continue cooking for a few extra minutes </li>
    </ol>
    
    <br>

    <p><strong>There you have it! A delicious Spanish Omelet!</strong></p>
